# Trusted and Privacy Enhanced Cloud Computing Environments (trustedCCEnvironment)

This repository includes all the code for the Trusted Cloud Computing Environment built for the MSc. Thesis Trusted and Privacy Enhanced Cloud Computing Environments, whose purpose is to design and implement a system flexible enough to let all the needed management activities be done while at the same time protecting user data privacy conditions, and availability guarantees. 

## Context

Cloud-based PaaS and SaaS solutions are being increasingly used as new extensions of services offered by different cloud-service providers. Such platforms or ready-to-use applications and services provide an easy way for developers to deploy, integrate or run complete outsourced services, at relatively low cost and low effort. These offers include valuable characteristics to address scalability, availability, elasticity, ubiquity and pay-peruse cost models. However, such environments, are managed by administrators, which operations are not controlled or audited by the users. These systems should make sure that management users (for example System Administrators) have no access to the private data being handled in different cloud computing nodes; therefore keeping the data from the end-users safe. 

The current cloud models entail security and privacy risks for its customers. PaaS providers are entrusted with applications, users’ computations, as as well as potentially confidential data processed, which may be leaked or tampered, as a result of ill-configured cloud infrastructure software, as well as, incorrect or not-well verified operations. 

To secure the cloud infrastructure from possible cloud administration threats, some solutions have been proposed in the past, making use of trusted computing technology. Despite the effectiveness of such solutions, the focus has been conducted on Infrastructureas- a-Service (IaaS) environments, in which the software stack to be maintained is considerably simpler than in PaaS solutions. Other interesting techniques for securing the management of PaaS infrastructures in current literature, always assume that the cloud administrator is fully trusted to perform the operational tasks, with the risk mitigated by the involvement of different roles of system administration teams, related to installation, setup, verification, testing or production follow-up tasks.

We purpose an architecture for trusted maintenance protocols to mitigate potential malicious or incorrect actions from systems’ administrators of PaaS and SaaS solutions. Our solution provides a secure and trustable environment, where privacy-enhanced applications and services can be supported on top of the current PaaS software-stack architectures. It also combines support for management multi-roles involving system administrators and auditing teams, in possible segregated administrative domains, while also supporting external auditing functions for independent auditors and possible verification’s from end-users. The key insight is that instead of never granting full administrative privileges on the computing nodes, we will allow the administrative personal the necessary privileges according to escalation policies enforced for multiple and segregated roles.

<!-- The designed solution supports cloud system management functions and protocols, running with trustworthy guarantees supported in a trustable execution environment leveraged by Intel SGX enabled processors for trusted execution and software attestation guarantees.

For our objectives we focused on the main contributions aligned with the following
requirements:

* Support for internal multi-role based operational and auditing teams, including
support for operational teams managing nodes hosting customers’ computations,
and auditing team members responsible for auditing and supervising their actions;

* Auditing teams may have members hired by the provider, but also external members
hired by customers, or designated by external regulation entities, whenever
necessary, with the possible support of remote-management auditing protocols executed
in a trustable way;

* Control of Operational States for nodes considered as trusted nodes to run customer’s
computations or workloads;

* Remote attestation protocols running under trustworthy guarantees, certifying the
relevant boot sequence of PaaS or SaaS stacks in systems’ configurations;

* Trustworthy guarantees of state-machine executions in supporting the management
protocols and functions. This includes event-logging of changes in operational
states of nodes, with procedures involved to assure the required liability and attestation
guarantees. -->
